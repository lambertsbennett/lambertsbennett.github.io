# About
## Current Work
I am currently working in the automotive industry as a data scientist/engineer with [Pierer Innovation](https://www.pierer-innovation.com/) in Austria. As part of the Data Science and Business Modeling team I carry out projects across most machine learning domains as well as data engineering and automation tasks. 

## Background
My educational background is Civil and Environmental Engineering. I carried out my bachelor's at the [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html), where I was lucky enough to be involved in some interesting research projects about oil sands tailings remediation. I enjoyed the research process, so I applied for Ph.D. programs across the U.S. and Canada. I was fortunate to be accepted to the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](https://mit.whoi.edu/), where my supervisors were [Heidi Sosik](https://www2.whoi.edu/staff/hsosik/), Rob Olson, and [Roman Stocker](https://stockerlab.ethz.ch/). In the Joint Program I worked on developing microfluidic devices to study bacteria and phytoplankton directly in the ocean. About 3 years in, Roman's lab relocated to [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and I moved to Switzerland to continue my studies. After a long 6 years, I finished my Ph.D. and was awarded a [Simon's Postdoctoral Fellowship in Marine Microbial Ecology](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/grant/simons-postdoctoral-fellowships-in-marine-microbial-ecology/#:~:text=The%20Simons%20Foundation%20invites%20applications,ocean%20processes%2C%20and%20vice%20versa.) to continue research at the University of Washington with [Ginger Armbrust](https://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/). It was there that my journey with machine learning started.

## Fun Stuff
What do I do when I'm not working? I play hockey whenever possible and also enjoy backcountry skiing and mountain biking.
